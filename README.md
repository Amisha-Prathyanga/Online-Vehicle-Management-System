## About The Project

Ceylon Cabs is the most famous online vehicle reservation system in Sri 
Lanka.This system allows customers to reserve vehicles via this platform. 
This allows customers to reserve vehicles via internet.
The basic functions of an online vehicle reservation system is to keep tracks 
of vehicles,customers and also booking.Itsupplies useful details to the 
administrator of the system such as giving daily reports of vehicles to be 
picked.And also sometimes it becomes as a vehicle management system by 
managing the use and prices of the vehicle.
Nowadays peoples travel from one place to another for many reasons 
because of their jobs, businesses, and vacations. As a result of that they are 
directed to prefer other options such as rentacab.Keeping in this mind our 
team has decided to make an online vehicle reservation system to book 
cabs,this system is not only for travel.This system helps for customers to 
choose different kinds of cabs available. Customers can book the cab 
according to their requirement and budget.
Also, if this system has any issue,the system has an online feedback service. 
After each customer has done with their transaction at the time logout,the 
system will ask for a feedback from the customer.The scheduling will be 
done online by the customer itself. Customers can select the duration of the 
tour.If the customer fail to return the cab in the above duration,the system 
will identify it and inform the customer to pay extra chargers.
And also, this system has a career portal. It supplies many job vacancies 
available in our system to people.So people can apply to these job 
vacancies. If the applicant have required qualifications that applicant can 
join with our team and work with us
